        "Info": "Our Sun, the center and heart of our solar system, is a yellow dwarf star. It keeps everything from the smallest pebbles to the biggest planets in its orbit. It composes 99.8% of the mass of our Solar System. It may seem large to us, but the Sun isn't as large as other types of stars. The Sun is a big ball of gas, about 4.5 billion years old, and composed of 92% hydrogen and &% helium. It's core is around 27 million degrees Fahrenheit. One day, the Sun will run out of energy, but that day is 6.5 billion years from now. So don't worry! The Sun has six regions: The core, the radiative zone, and the convective zone in the interior; the visible surface, called the photosphere; the chromosphere; and the outermost region, the corona. The different zones have different temperatures and functions and each zone is important. However, the core of the Sun is where the magic happens. That's where hydrogen is converted to helium in a process called thermonuclear fusion. This fusion powers the Sun and quite simply, allows for life on Earth to even take place. It is thr Sun's warmth and energy(and our perfect distance from the Sun), which allow life to exist. And while that seems very important to us, we're not even the center of the galaxy! We're in a spiral arm of the Milky Way Galaxy, called the Orion Spur. We're infinitesimally small in the grand scheme of things and we've got to be okay with that!",

        "info": "Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and first of the four terrestrial planets. It's called a terrestrial planet because it's rocky. It has the highest concentration of Nickel out of all the planets. Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system, and its only slightly larger than Earth's moon. Mercury is 2.5x smaller than Earth. Because Mercury is so small, it's gravitational pull is around 3x less than that of Earth's. Despite it being the closest planet to the Sun, it is not the hottest. That title goes to Venus due to Venus' dense atmosphere. However, Mercury does receive light from the Sun the fastest, at 2.7 minutes. Mercury has an egg-shaped orbit around the Sun, which leads to a strange phenomenon: Mercury's revolutionary period(A revolution is how long it takes a planet to move around the entirety of the Sun.) is longer than it's day! A solar day (a day-night cycle in space) on Mercury is 176 days, while a year on Mercury is 88 days. Mercury's year is half as short as a single solar day!",

        "info": "Venus, also referred to as Earth's Evil Twin, is the second planet from the sun. It is the second of the four terrestrial planets. A planet is classified as a terrestrial planet if it has a rocky surface. Venus and Earth have a couple of similarities that make them twins. They're just about the same size. Both planets have an atmosphere, but Venus' is caustic and makes the chances of life to exist very marginal. It features extremely high temperatures due to it's dense atmosphere and thick sulfur clouds. Surface temperatures on Venus can reach up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, which is hot enough to melt lead. Venus' surface is a rusty color and littered with thousands of volcanoes, some of which scientists believe are still active today. Those active volcanoes may be what create the sulfuric acid clouds in the sky. The air pressure on Venus is around 90x stronger than Earth's. To experience the same pressure on Earth, you'd have to be about a mile under the sea! The longest a probe has lasted on Venus is 2 hours, due to the intense pressure. Like Mercury, a sol on Venus is longer than a year. A Venusian sol is 243 days while it's year is 225 days. Another difference is that Venus rotates backwards on it's axis. This means, on Venus, the Sun rises in the West and sets in the East. It is the only planet to do so. Having painted Venus as a hostile environment to all life, scientists still believe there is a chance for life in the clouds, in the form of tiny microbes.",

        "info": "Home! The third planet from the Sun and third of the four terrestrial planets. Earth is rocky just like the others. Earth features gorgeous sights, hundreds of elements, varying weather conditions, and most importantly, LIFE! That's how we're even writing this to you. Earth has one moon, which we call, the moon. The moon is so far away from Earth that 30 Earth-sized planets could fit in between the Earth we live on and the moon we see in the sky. It's not as close as it looks! Our revolutionary period is 365 days and hour days are rounded to 24 hours each. The Earth is about 93 million miles from the Sun and due to our relative closeness to the Sun, light from the Sun only takes 8 minutes to get to Earth. Our ozone layer protects us from the radiation the Sun emits and also helps form our atmosphere. Our atmosphere, which consists of 5 layers, is about 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and 1% other elements. The atmosphere also breaks up meteoroids before they hit the surface. Earth's surface is 70% water and that water, on average, is about 2.5 miles deep. Most of Earth's volcanoes are in the ocean. Earth itself is composed of four main layers, the inner core, the outer core, the mantle, and the crust. The inner core is a solid sphere made of nickel and iron. The outer core is made of the same elements but they're fluids instead. The mantle, which is the thickest of the four layers, is a viscous mixture of molten rock. The crust is the layer we live on top of, and where the aforementioned volcanoes and mountains reside. Earth is the perfect planet for life and we look for planets that replicate the same conditions to find similar beings.",

        "info": "Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun and last of the terrestrial planets. Mars, named after the Roman god of war, is a cold, dusty, desert planet with a very thin atmosphere. It is the most explored planet in the Solar System, besides Earth. Currently Mars has two rovers, Curiosity and Perseverance, one lander, InSight, and one helicopter, Ingenuity, exploring its surface. If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be the size of a dime, and Mars would be about as big as an aspirin tablet. Mars has two moons named Phobos and Deimos. The two moons were discovered by astronaut Asaph Hall. Mars and its ensemble make a complete orbit around the Sun in 687 days. We've even given Mars a nickname, the Red Planet, because the iron minerals in Mars' crust oxidize(rust) and make the planet look red. Like the rest of the terrestrial planets, Mars features canyons, volcanoes, rocks, and dust. Mars houses the largest volcano in the entire Solar System, Olympus Mons. Mars houses another absolute unit of a planetary feature: Valleris Maneris. Valleris Maneris is 10x larger than Earth's own Grand Canyon. Mars has an extremely thin atmosphere, which is 96% carbon dioxide. It would be very tough for a human to live there without more oxygen in the air. It is believed that Mars exhibited more signs of life because there are remnants of water and warmth from eons prior. There is also water in mars' polar ice caps. Water on Mar is short lived because of Mars' lack of atmosphere. The goal is to eventually get humans on the surface of Mars. Life on Mars would be difficult to adjust to solely because of the atmosphere. Heat escapes the planet very quickly, there would be no protection from the elements, comets, or asteroids, and the dust storms get so bad it takes months for the dust to settle after having one. A day on Mars is called a sol because it shares a similar day length to Earth. A sol on Mars clocks in at 24.6 hours. In addition, Mars has seasons, just like Earth, but they last longer because of Mars' distance from the Sun. We hope to one day colonize our neighbor and become an interplanetary species.",

        "info": "Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun, is an enigmatic and special planet. It sits at a comfortable distance of 468 million miles away from the Sun. The first scientist to make detailed observations of Jupiter was Galileo Galilei in 1610. It's the largest of all planets in our Solar System and more massive than all of the other planets combined times two. Thus, it is named Jupiter, after the king of the ancient Roman gods. Jupiter is a gas giant, meaning it doesn't have a solid surface but may have a solid core. We are not sure yet. Jupiter is covered in swirling cloud stripes and famously has the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that has been raging for hundreds of years. The planet's stripes and swirls are actually clouds of ammonia. The Great Red Spot itself is bigger than Earth and scientists do not know if the Great Red Spot or Little Red Spot are shallow or go all the way down to the surface. If Earth were the size of a grape, Jupiter would be the size of a basketball. Jupiter is incomprehensibly big. Despite it being so big, a day on Jupiter is only 10 hours long. The planet rotates extremely quickly, which gives the clouds the stripe shape we see. Jupiter does however, take 12 Earth years to orbit the Sun. Jupiter's atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, which is why the planet is so light. Jupiter even has the biggest ocean in the Solar System, an ocean of liquid hydrogen. Nine spacecraft total have observed Jupiter, and the most recent, Juno is currently orbiting the planet. It goes without saying that an object so large must have a massive collection of smaller objects orbiting it. Jupiter has over 75 moons. One moon in particular is bigger than Mercury itself, Ganymede. In addition to having one of the biggest space parties, Jupiter has rings surrounding it as well. They're hard to see but they were first discovered in 1979. Currently, there are no rockets powerful enough to blast straight into the outer Solar System. Scientists had to get clever and use Jupiter's gravity to slingshot spacecraft further out. There is so much to learn about the king of the planets and scientists are trying their hardest to advance technology so we can find out more.",

        "info": "Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun and second largest in our Solar System, is more majestic and eye-catching than AC during a heat wave. Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Saturn does not have a solid surface, but may have a solid core somewhere in there. It has the most complex ring system in our entire Solar system. There are 9 in total and each is made of ice chunks and rocks. They are thought to be pieces of comets, asteroids, or shattered moons that were broken up by Saturn's intense gravity. Twice every 29 and a half years, Saturn appears ringless due to an optical illusion. The position that Saturn lies in makes it hard for Earthlings and telescopes to see the beautiful rings. Also orbiting Saturn are 53 known moons and 29 potential candidates. In total there are 82 bodies orbiting the giant. Saturn's moons hold many mysteries. Titan has methane lakes, Enceladus sprays water, and Phoebe is riddled with craters. Titan is one of two moons in the entire Solar System, that we've discovered, that have an atmosphere. An atmosphere is crucial to supporting human life.Because both Titan and Enceladus have oceans, it may be possible to support life there. Life is not possible on Saturn as we know it. Saturn has the second shortest day in the Solar System, coming in at 10.7 hours per day. However, it takes 29 Earth years to orbit the Sun. Like Jupiter, Saturn is covered in cloud stripes and streams because of its fast rotation. Winds in the upper atmosphere reach 500 meters per second. The clouds at Saturn's north pole form a hexagon, for unknown reasons. This shape is unique to Saturn. No other planet has a cloud shaped like that. The cloud was first noticed by the Cassini spacecraft, a spacecraft intentionally sent to Saturn to observe it and eventually die (get crushed by it's gravity when it runs out of fuel). Saturn also has its own variation of the Great Red Spot, called a Great White Spot. The colors differ because of the atmospheres of the planets. Saturn is the least dense planet in the Solar System. If there was a bathtub filled with water that could fit Saturn, Saturn would float at the top, as it is less dense than water.",

        "info": "Uranus, the sideways planet, is the 7th planet from the Sun and just as quirky as every planet named before it. Uranus is an Ice Giant and called the sideways planet because it rotates on its side. It rotates on its side because during its formation, it was struck by rogue objects that knocked it sideways. It was the first planet to be discovered using a telescope, in 1781, by William Herschel. Uranus is 4x larger than Earth. If Earth were an apple, Uranus would be a basketball. Uranus is classified as an Ice Giant because most of its mass is a hot dense fluid of icy materials - water, methane and ammonia. All of that is wrapped around a small rocky core. The planet is cold and windy. The atmosphere is made mostly of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of methane. The methane is what gives Uranus its unique blue color. Uranus' 27 moons are named after literary characters, most coming from Shakespeare plays. They're about half ice-water and half rock. In addition to 27 moons, Uranus also has 13 rings. The inner rings are dimly colored, making them hard to see, and the outer rings are brighter. We don't have much concrete, specified information on Uranus because the only spacecraft to observe it was Voyager 2, on its way out of the Solar System. Uranus is so far out in the solar system, one revolution around the Sun takes 84 Earth years. Uranus has a day of about 17 hours. Uranus being tilted on its side leads to very strange seasons as well. The planet's north pole experiences 21 years of nighttime in winter, 21 years of daytime in summer and 42 years of day and night in the spring and fall. Like Venus, Uranus rotates east to west. Uranus' awkward weather patterns and extremely high speed winds allow for its very own Great Dark Spot. When Uranus' approaches equinox it exhibits dynamic cloud formations, meaning you could see a different Uranus several decades apart. Uranus even has a Uranus-esque moon, named Margaret, that rotates retrograde to the planet. Uranus is definitely the standout planet in the Solar System. It operates on its own terms and does so with joy. ",

        "info": "Neptune, the eighth and most distant planet in our Solar System, is just as mysterious as they come. Named after the Roman god of the ocean, Neptune is the only planet that cannot be seen by the naked human eye and the first planet to be calculated through mathematical means. It was discovered in 1846 and completed it's first 165 year orbit in 2011. Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune. It did so on its way out of the Solar System. It is an Ice Giant, just like Uranus. That means most of its mass is hot, dense icy material - water, methane, and ammonia. Its atmosphere is made up of hydrogen, helium, and methane as well. Due to their similar element composition, both planets are hues of blue(Uranus is blue-green, while Neptune is more vibrantly blue due to an unknown element). Scientists also believe that there is an ocean of super hot water under Neptune's cold clouds that does not boil away because of the immense pressure that keeps the planet together. If Earth was a nickel, Neptune would be a basketball. Neptune flies at an average distance of 2.8 billion miles from the sun. It has 14 known moons, most of which are named after minor sea gods and nymphs in Greek mythology. Neptune is also the last of the four planets which have rings. Neptune has six. Dwarf planet PLuto's elliptical orbit sometimes makes it so that Neptune is farther from the Sun than it. Pluto and Neptune will never crash into each other because of the speed at which they orbit the Sun. For every three laps Neptune takes, Pluto takes two. Neptune is also the Solar System's windiest world, with winds raging at 1,200mph. Earth's most powerful winds only move at 250mph. Neptune's axis is tilted in the same regard that Mars and Earth's are. So tNeptune experiences seasons, but each season is just over 40 years. Neptune's biggest moon Triton, is the only moon classified as a large moon, that rotates retrograde to its parent planet's orbit. This means Neptune's gravity is so strong is commandeered a rogue object. Despite Triton being -391 degrees Fahrenheit, Voyager 2 observed geysers spewing icy material upward into Triton's skies. Scientists have also discovered that Triton's atmosphere is growing warmer, and they do not know why. In addition to the enigma that is Neptune, Neptune is so big that it's gravitational force affects the Kuiper Belt behind it. We still have much to learn about Neptune. One day we will have the technology to do so.",
