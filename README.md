# Solar System Education
Capstone Project

## Frontend
### Requirements
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 10
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/usage) 
    * With node installed, simply run: `npm install -g yarn`
    * Sidenote: we're using [yarn 2](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/migration) but with the `node_modules` strategy so we can get the benefits of yarn 2 without the breaking changes that make it incompatible with many things. 

### Installation

Clone the repo and go into the client folder:

`git clone git@github.com:isharastphard/Solar-System-Education.git`

`cd Solar-System-Education/client`

The simply run `yarn` to install dependencies.

### Development

Run `yarn start` to start the client at [localhost:3000]([localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).

Hot reloading is enabled so the react app will auto reload when files are saved.
